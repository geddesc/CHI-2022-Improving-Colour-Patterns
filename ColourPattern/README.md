# Colour Pattern Study

This is the code we used to run the study. 

## Task Implementations

To go ahead and checkout each task implementation you will need to check under the lib folder in study_src and then finally in ColourTasks. The tutorials are seperate from the actual tasks, and can be found based on including either intro or tutorial after the task name. 

## Pattern Implementations

To see the pattern implementation you will similar to the task implementation have to look under the lib and then under the study_src folders, then you will find the implementations under the ColourPatterns Folder. In this folder you can find the pattern introduction pages (pattern_name_introduction.dart), the widgets which create the box size and draw each pattern (pattern_name_widget.dart), and the concrete implementation which draws the pattern using a canvas (pattern_name.dart).
