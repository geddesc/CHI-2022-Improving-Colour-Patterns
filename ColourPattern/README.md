# Colour Pattern Study

This is the code we used to run the study. 

## Task Implementations

To go ahead and checkout each task implementation you will need to check under the lib folder in study_src and then finally in ColourTasks. The tutorials are seperate from the actual tasks, and can be found based on including either intro or tutorial after the task name. 

## Pattern Implementations

To see the pattern implementation you will similar to the task implementation have to look under the lib and then under the study_src folders, then you will find the implementations under the ColourPatterns Folder. In this folder you can find the pattern introduction pages (pattern_name_introduction.dart), the widgets which create the box size and draw each pattern (pattern_name_widget.dart), and the concrete implementation which draws the pattern using a canvas (pattern_name.dart).

## Running the code

The easiest way to run the code will be to run "flutter run -d chrome". Otherwise if you would like to host the project you will have to run "flutter run build web" and then transfer the files that were built and host the resulting index.html file (all can be found in the build folder).
